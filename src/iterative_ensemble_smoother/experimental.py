    Explanation of row scaling
    --------------------------

    The ESMDA update can be written as:

        X_post = X_prior + X_prior @ K

    where K is a transition matrix. The core of the row scaling approach is that
    for each row i in the matrix X, we apply an update with strength alpha:

        X_post = X_prior + alpha * X_prior @ K
        X_post = X_prior @ (I + alpha * K)

    Clearly 0 <= alpha <= 1 denotes the 'strength' of the update; alpha == 1
    corresponds to a normal smoother update and alpha == 0 corresponds to no
    update. With the per row transformation of X the operation is no longer matrix
    multiplication but the pseudo code looks like:

        for i in rows:
            X_i_post = X_i_prior @ (I + alpha_i * K)
