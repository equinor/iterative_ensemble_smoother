## Papers

### SIES (Subspace Iterative Ensemble Smoother)

An optimization approach.
The observations are perturbed once, and we use the Gauss-Newton algorithm to minimize a cost function.
The proposed algorithm has state across iterations in a matrix $W$, which makes it more challenging to reason about compared to ESMDA.

### ESMDA (Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation)

The idea behind ESMDA is to inflate the covariance of the observations and update several times.
In the Gauss-Linear case, this makes no difference.
The hope is that for non-linear forward models, it's better to make many small updates rather than one big update.
Just like with SIES, there are no theoretical guarantees.
One difference between ESMDA and SIES is that ESMDA perturbs in each iteration, whereas SIES perturbs once.
The 2013 paper is the main paper, but the others are related too.
